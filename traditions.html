				<p>My parents enjoyed making us suffer and keeping photographic evidence of it. Throughout the late 80s-early 90s, 
				   we often had Christmas-themed outfits that coordinated well together. My little sister and I were often in 
				   matching dresses while my brothers wore complementing colors (except the year they wore matching lederhosen, 
				   which has become a favorite running joke we bring out every Christmas. They always made sure that we all looked 
				   good together, whether it be in matching outfits or in color-coordinating outfits. Now we try to make sure that 
				   we don't wear too many similar outfits (in the last few years, we have all verified what we were wearing ahead 
				   of time to avoid matching).</p>

		<h2>Someone to ruin Christmas</h2>
			<p>It is really not officially Christmas at my house until it has been declared ruined. Confession: I am usually the 
			   person who &ldquo;wins&rdquo; this honor. It is usually awarded after I do something totally ridiculous or 
			   unintentionally funny such as leaving all the price tags on everyone's presents when I wrap them (this happened once
			   when I was 12 and I still hear about it). It all started one year when I went on a rant about my hatred for basically
			   everything on the Christmas dinner menu (see <a href=food.html>food</a> for more on this) and my mom specifically 
			   said &ldquo;Kate-you just RUINED Christmas.&rdquo; After that it became a running joke to see how I could 
			   &ldquo;ruin&rdquo; Christmas every year and if anyone else did something worthy of it, they were given the title 
			   (unfortunately this has only happened two other times). Luckily for me, my brother&apos;s fianc√©e, as the newest 
			   guest, was given the honor last year (for deciding to take a nap and dressing their dog up in a Santa suit) and will 
			   probably win again this year since my brothers like to tease her.</p>

		<div class="traditions mass">
		<h2>Complaining about Mass</h2>
			<p>We have gone to Christmas Eve 4:30/5:00pm mass for as long as I can remember. Part of this tradition involves my
			   mother panicking that we are going to be too &ldquo;late&rdquo; to get seats. &ldquo;Late&rdquo; usually means we are
			   at our house at 3:15(we live 5 minutes away). My brothers and I have fought this for years and once my oldest brother
			   turned 16, began to drive on our own. Every year, my mom begrudgingly accepts this but always states, &ldquo;this 
			   year I'm not saving you seats, so if you have to stand you only have yourselves to blame!&rdquo; and every year when 
			   we show up at 4:00 (sometimes after a text/call from my dad), our seats are still there and we still get stuck 
			   sitting around (my dad enforces an iphones ban in church) waiting for mass to begin because it <i>always</i> starts
			   late.</p>

		<h2>Playing some version of Trivial Pursuit & Arguing</h2>
		    <p>Christmas night is when one of the more important traditions occurs at the Schmitt house. While regular board games
		       have been banned for awhile (there have been a few unfortunate instances of games ending in tears or fistfights), 
		       Trivial Pursuit&trade; has become our go-to game since &ldquo;it requires actual knowledge and skills unlike 
		       Monopoly&trade;,&rdquo; as my dad once stated. We own several versions (from the original 1980s version to the 90s
		       edition) and try to switch it up every year. We generally play at night and the game can take a few hours depending
		       on the version, but it almost always involves some sort of dispute. The now infamous game of 2009 involved my mom 
		       getting tired of the game and letting my oldest brother answer a question wrong to win, much to my other brother and
		       my anger (&ldquo;the tunnel but it&apos;s clever or something&rdquo; is not the same thing as &ldquo;The Chunnel,&rdquo;
		       no matter what he claims). The game is also marked by everyone knowing the answer to every question but the ones they 
		       were asked so there is a lot of ribbing if you get your question wrong since everyone knows the answer to it. There 
		       is quite a bit of trash&ndash;talking as well since it is a point of pride to be the &ldquo;Christmas Trivial Pursuit&trade;  
		       Champion&rdquo; since the title lasts for a year and can be used to bolster any argument occuring throughout the next
		       year. No Christmas at the Schmitts is complete without some friendly competition over who knows the most useless
		       trivia.</p>
