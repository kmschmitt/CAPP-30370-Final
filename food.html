				<p>There is an unwritten rule at Christmas that is basically:&ldquo;there is no such thing as too many 
				   cookies!&rdquo; My mom and I tinker around with the list (generally we try one new type every year and 
				   if it is good, it may make the annual cut. All of the cookies have to be done by the night of the 23rd, 
				   so they can be made into plates that are delivered by my dad, my little sister, and myself on Christmas 
				   Eve morning. Generally the cookie trays include my great-grandmother&apos;s cut out cookies (both 
				   frosted ones and ones with sugar sprinkles), buckeyes (sorry to the Michigan grad reading this-my family
				   hates TOSU but loves the desert!), peanut blossoms, mint brownies, 7 layer bars, monster cookies, peanut 
				   clusters, and chocolate pretzel Os. We also include several bags of mixes that alternate years and 
				   can be homemade chex mix, reindeer mix, puppy chow, or spiced nuts. Over the years, these trays have 
				   become legendary, so much so that we are pretty sure that when our former babysitter moved back to town 
				   with her family, she chose to live on our street so she could get her own plate,instead of having to 
				   share the one her family receives. Sometimes my mom decides that she is going to cut down on the cookies 
				   that year, but she inevitably runs into someone from the list that tells her they can&apos;t wait to get 
				   the cookies, especially the (insert what she wanted to cut here), so we never actually cut the list down 
				   to be smaller. Baking and decorating the cookies is probably my favorite part of Christmas preparations.</p>

			<h2>Cinnamon Rolls</h2>
				<p>We only get homemade cinnamon rolls at our house 3 times a year (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter), but
			   	   there is something extra magical about them on Christmas. My mom puts them in the oven right before we are 
			   	   all woken up (after 9am per the rules that went into effect once we realized the presents were not going 
			   	   anywhere) so that the smell of them baking is present as we drift downstairs. Then they finish cooking right 
			   	   after we are done opening the presents. We then sit around and eat them while drinking coffee. They are such 
			   	   an integral part of our Christmas that when my brother went to his fianc√©e&apos;s family, he got the recipe 
			   	   to make them (sadly unlike my mom & me, he did not inherit the baking gene and his were not as good, which 
			   	   he took to be a sign that they were only to be made in our house and not shared with people outside the 
			   	   family).</p>

			<div class="food dinner">
			<h2>Christmas Dinner</h2>
				<p>This is probably my least favorite thing we do for Christmas because I really do not enjoy any of the food, 
			       except the rolls. Traditionally, we also have honey&ndash;baked ham, cheesy potatoes, and greenbean 
			       casserole. When I was younger, I used to get really upset by the fact that we had the same &ldquo;icky food 
			       every year,&rdquo; resulting in me trying to find leftovers from the night before to eat because my mom 
			       refused to make me anything else (and I had already upset her with the rant and usually was accused of 
			       ruining Christmas. Finally, when I turned 16, she realized I was probably never going to eat any of it and 
			       began to make me a chicken breast, baked potato, and some steamed vegetable. To this day, I still have this 
			       meal as an alternative to the meal my family eats (and I occasionally still rant-but it is not a yearly
			       occurrence anymore).</p>

			<div class="food drinks">       
			<h2>Speciality Drinks</h2>
				<p>Every year we seem to have a drink specifically made or chosen for the night. The first time this happened
				   was a bit of a fluke since my brothers and I found a bottle of liquour my parents had bought on their
				   honeymoon in Bermuda. We all ended up drinking a bit of it with them. The next year my mom made this winter
				   sangria that she really wanted to try. This year she found a recipe that used Fireball Whiskey. In general,
				   my family has very different tastes in liquor, but on Christmas we all have at least one of the same 
				   drinks as a family.</p>
